# Cursor_Movement_By_Hand_Tracking_System
🖐️ Cursor_Movement_By_Hand_Tracking_System - This project uses computer vision (OpenCV &amp; Mediapipe) to track your hand in real-time via your webcam, translating gestures into smooth, touchless cursor movements. It’s like giving your computer a magical sixth sense—no mouse or touchpad needed!
