Theoretical Explanation of the Code
Library Imports:

cv2: For accessing and processing video frames using OpenCV.

mediapipe: For detecting hand landmarks using the MediaPipe hand tracking solution.

pyautogui: For simulating mouse actions like movement and clicks.

Initialization:

The webcam is accessed using cv2.VideoCapture(0).

The MediaPipe hand detector is initialized to track hand landmarks.

Screen dimensions are retrieved using pyautogui.size() to map hand positions to screen coordinates.

Main Loop (Real-Time Video Capture & Processing):

A frame is captured from the webcam and horizontally flipped for mirror-like interaction.

The frame is converted from BGR to RGB as required by MediaPipe.

The hand detector processes the frame and returns detected hand landmarks.

Hand Landmark Processing:

If any hands are detected:

Landmarks are drawn on the hand using MediaPipeâ€™s drawing utilities.

Each landmark is iterated through, and the (x, y) coordinates are scaled to the frame size.

Gesture Recognition:

Index Finger (Landmark ID 8):

The position of the index finger tip is used to calculate screen coordinates (index_x, index_y) and a circle is drawn at the fingertip.

Thumb (Landmark ID 4):

The thumb tip position is also tracked and drawn similarly.

The vertical distance between the index finger and thumb is calculated.

If the distance is small (less than 20 pixels), it is interpreted as a click gesture, and a mouse click is triggered.

If the distance is moderately small (less than 100 pixels), it is interpreted as a move gesture, and the mouse is moved to the calculated index finger position.

Display and Loop Continuation:

The processed video frame (with annotations) is displayed in a window titled "Virtual Mouse".

The loop continues to run, capturing and processing frames in real-time.

Conclusion
This code creates a virtual mouse by tracking the user's hand through a webcam. It detects the position of the index finger to move the mouse cursor and recognizes a click gesture based on the relative position of the thumb to the index finger. The system combines computer vision, gesture recognition, and automation to create an intuitive, touchless interaction interface.
